# ETN-helper

ETN-helper is a collection of scripts I decided to make to shorted the amount of typing I have to do when using the commandline because I hate typing. Presently I only have linux scripts available as that is the system I use, but if you use Windows or Mac OS please consider contributing your own scripts to make them available to others. Just clone this repository, add your scripts an do a pull request.
